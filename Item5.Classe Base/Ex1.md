When the application is run, the console output must be the following text:
Log started
Base: Log continuing
Finished
You need to ensure that the application outputs the correct text.

Note:
* The abstract keyword enables you to create classes and class members that are
incomplete and must be implemented in a derived class.
* An abstract class cannot be instantiated. The purpose of an abstract class is to provide a
common definition of a base class that multiple derived classes can share.
